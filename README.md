# Macroscope
This is a basic, constant-height, contact mode profilometer/AFM. It's really more of a demonstration piece but ~10 miron resolution can be achieved with some patience.

# Results
### Canadian nickel scanned at 1.75mm/s, 0.25mm resolution, 88x88 pixels 
A "quick" scan. It took 46 minutes.

### 3D printed test sample with 0.1mm steps. Scanned at 0.5mm/s, 0.05mm resolution, 150x50 pixels
You might be able to see the diagonal print lines on the lowest step.

# Control
This machine is programmed using SCPI-ish ASCII commands over a serial port.\
The control GUI we used for the prototype machines can be found here: https://github.com/JarofMolasses/macroscope_control.
